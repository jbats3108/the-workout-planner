# Plan

Working backlog for OVRLOAD v2. Update this as items ship or get deferred. Domain language stays in `CONTEXT.md`; hard decisions stay in `docs/adr/`.

**Grill cleanup:** when a grilled feature ships, delete its `## Grill: …` section. Move any still-open deferred bullets into **Backlog**; do not keep decided implementation notes here.

**Notion inbox:** after pulling bullets from Notion [Ovrload](https://app.notion.com/p/3aae5dd99f0c80ad928ade1a5c6b0749) into this file, clear **only** the list items under `## Backlog:` — leave that header and a single empty bullet (`-`). Do not replace the whole page or delete child pages / other sections.

## Now

- **Invite email (Resend)** — create+send requires recipient; see **Grill: Invite email**
- **FAQ page** — scaffold at `/beta-tester-faqs` (public, noindex, not linked from `/`); fill copy + interest form URL (invite requests) + feedback form URL; draft on Notion [FAQ Page](https://app.notion.com/p/3aae5dd99f0c8006a6cbf6df379661a8)
- **Since-last-deload counts** — per routine on dashboard (finished standards since that routine’s latest finished deload); soft Deload hint at ≥ **Deload Velocity** (`deload_every_n`, editor + Training defaults; 0 = never); no shared cycle counter

## Grill: Invite email

Decided 2026-08-03. Ship deletes this section.

- Bearer register link (no email lock at signup)
- Create requires recipient email; create+send one step; sync Mail; rollback invite if send fails
- Persist `email` on invite; Resend to stored address only (wrong address → revoke + new)
- List: Copy + Resend; drop mailto
- Custom Blade HTML matching app brand (near-black + neon yellow + OVR mark); note admin-only; name creator; Reply-To = admin
- Success flash “Invite sent to {email}.” + Copy still available
- Out of scope: inbound mailbox, queue, change recipient on resend

## Shipped (recent)

Gym-test 2026-07-28 + 2026-07-26 + remaining product history. Newest first within each batch where noted.

1. **Exercise catalog curation** — curated 174 shared lifts (original short list + selective free-exercise-db); `exercises:import` soft-deletes extras unless `--no-prune`
2. **Nicer confirms** — ~~replace browser `confirm`/`alert` with in-app dialogs~~ done (`confirmDialog` + `ConfirmDialogHost`; RestStage inline skip unchanged)
3. **"Block" naming** — ~~UI/copy only: Play/History drop “Block N” (show `Superset` when needed); Up next drops Block N; setup hints use exercise names; editor/settings leftover noun = Exercise; domain `Block` unchanged~~ done
4. **Set x/y in exercise header (Play)** — ~~set progress in the big exercise header (and log sheet), labeled Warm-up / Working~~ done
5. **Bump when mode** — ~~Settings “Bump when”: Any set / Last set at top weight; snapshotted on workout start; Floor kept for carry-forward; Bump = prescribed Target (no separate Progression Target / editor Bump); log sheet `Floor X. Bump @ Y`; confirm on finish + history re-eval~~ done
6. **PWA app shell** — ~~tabbed app shell; haptics~~ done (mobile bottom tabs: Dashboard · History · Training · Settings; desktop sidebar unchanged; player haptics on Done / Log set; rest-end vibrate already shipped)
7. **Duplicate routine** — ~~clone an existing routine as a starting point~~ done (POST duplicate; deep-copies blocks / set groups / warm-ups / dropsets / deload; opens editor as `{name} (copy)`)
8. **Superset setup preview** — ~~show both exercises during setup~~ done (Setup Up Next lists A + B for the upcoming round)
9. **History: group block sets** — ~~group sets by block in history UI~~ done (one section per block; working sets grouped by exercise)

11. **Progression defaults UI** — ~~Settings Achievement Floor / Progression Target + editor Floor / Bump overrides~~ done (empty override inherits user default; placeholders from Settings)

34. **More app-like mobile behaviour** — ~~chrome polish: safe areas, player full-bleed (no AppLayout), leave confirm, overscroll off on player+editor~~ done (PWA install #5; bottom nav in #1)
35. **User default warm-up %s and reps** — ~~prefs on the user; per-step %×reps on warm-up steps; seed into new blocks; Settings → Training~~ done
36. **Restyle whole app to match Overload branding** — ~~zinc + lime~~ done: dark-first near-black + neon yellow primary + cyan accent (`docs/branding.md`, `resources/css/app.css`)
37. **Find and import exercises** — ~~shared catalog JSON + `exercises:import` + seeder; editor find filter; index scoped to `forUser`~~ done (~80 lifts)

41. **Rebrand to OVRLOAD** — ~~rename product surfaces to **OVRLOAD**; mark/icon and related chrome around **OVR** / \*\*OVRLD~~\*\* done (`docs/branding.md`; logos, home, auth, `APP_NAME`)
42. **Plate calculator UI** — ~~Settings for bars/plates; player shows nearest loadable stack~~ done

- Equipment classification: catalog `equipment` on exercises; snapshot into workouts; plate guide only for barbell / E-Z curl bar

42. **Player / editor UX polish** — ~~finish/abandon in-progress; edit affordance; exercise find results; mobile editor scroll, compact warm-up, in-card search, add-block placement~~ done
43. **Warm-up weight prefill in Play** — ~~incomplete warm-up sets should fill the weight field from `% × working` (`target_weight_kg`), not the previous logged warm-up; fix Target label `v-else` on reps~~ done
44. **Warm-up setup steps** — ~~plan setup (press-when-done) pauses inside the warm-up flow, not only setup-after-block~~ done (`has_setup_after_warm_up`: once between last warm-up and first working)
45. **Rest after warm-ups** — ~~make warm-up group rest first-class in editor + Play (rest after warm-up sets / before working)~~ done (editor exposes WU rest; Play already used group rest)
46. **Clear block warm-up** — ~~one-tap remove all warm-up steps from a block in the editor~~ done
47. **Warm-up defaults scope** — ~~Settings: seed warm-ups into every new block vs first block only~~ done

49. **Login screen on every open** — ~~authenticated users hitting `/` saw the guest home/login UI; bfcache could restore stale guest pages after sign-in~~ done (home redirect + guest-page bfcache reload)

## Backlog

Single triage list — reprioritize across buckets as needed. **Features (FAQ)** are listed on the public help/FAQ page for beta testers. **Polish & mobile integration** is shipped-flow UX, not net-new capability. Notion [inbox](https://app.notion.com/p/3aae5dd99f0c80ad928ade1a5c6b0749) → pull new bullets into the right bucket below.

### Features (FAQ)

Public order matches `/beta-tester-faqs`.

1. **Tutorial** — walkthrough for settings, routines, create/manage
2. **Add Historical Workouts** — log a past workout without Play (date/time + weights on one screen); grill: progression re-eval, warm-ups, deload flag
3. **Better History Edits** — warm-up edits; discarded in History; add/remove exercises and sets on a logged workout
4. **Support for lbs** — end-to-end preferred unit (API still kg-centric today)
5. **Choose an alternate exercise for Deload sessions** — swap lift only on deload starts
6. **Gym dumbbell / rack inventory** — full rack range for run-the-rack / planning
7. **Viewable Progression Data** — charts/tables/export; large feature, own grill later

### Parked (internal — not on public FAQ)

- **Strava integration** — OAuth / export / privacy grill later
- **Garmin sync** — after Strava
- **Demote dropset → single in Play**
- **Ad-hoc setup from player** — beyond planned `has_setup_after`
- **Transition duration preference** — stored pref for A→B pause in supersets (today client-side)
- **Dropsets on supersets**
- **Flaky-network drafts** — best-effort offline/queue for player logging

### Polish & mobile integration

- 

### Bugfixes

-

### Code quality & security

- **Check test function name conventions** — audit PHPUnit / Vitest names for consistency (`it_…` / `test_…` / describe+it wording) and align or document the house style
- **GDPR compliance?** — clarify whether/what is required (privacy policy, data export/delete, retention, cookies); grill before building

                    When you create a routine, choosing a profile is required in the first step. Your

                    explicitly override Floor when needed. Profiles also carry working Rest, a complete warm-up ladder, and deload weight/reps
                    factors. Warm-up steps can be a percent of working weight, your empty bar, or a fixed kg — useful when a 20&nbsp;kg bar does not
                    suit a lift like deadlift.

                    In the routine editor, each exercise has a profile selector. Selecting a different profile copies its Profile Details into that
                    exercise. Target, Floor, Rest, and warm-up stay collapsed until you choose Custom settings (or Customise). Editing a profile-owned
                    value makes that block or exercise
                    <strong class="text-foreground">Custom</strong>; saving those Profile Details as a profile is explicit. Use

                    (nothing is written until you Save the routine). Deload weight/reps factors always follow the profile: changing them on the
                    profile auto-updates every assigned exercise (no “Update routines” step for those fields).

                    Supersets can use a different profile for A and B. Their Target/Floor values are separate, but warm-ups and working Rest are
                    shared by the pair. Changing a profile does not rewrite existing blocks. You can explicitly choose to update eligible existing
                    uses after editing a custom profile. Custom profiles in use cannot be deleted or archived until you choose a different profile in
                    those routines. Preferences lists a routine when that profile is the routine profile or selected on an exercise — leftover rest or
                    warm-up links after switching an exercise to Custom do not count.

                    Choose a profile before naming the routine. A routine is a list of exercises (internally, blocks). Each exercise has working sets
                    and a profile. Working sets, Target, Floor, and warm-up reps use
                    <strong class="text-foreground">steppers</strong> (+/−) — you can clear a field while editing; Save requires a valid whole number
                    in range. On mobile, the first tab is a <strong class="text-foreground">Routine</strong> sheet (name, routine profile,
                    Progression, Deload); exercise tabs come after. On desktop, the same routine-level controls live in a collapsed

                    when a workout starts. Target, Floor, Rest, and warm-ups stay hidden while a profile is selected — choose
                    <strong class="text-foreground">Custom settings</strong> (or Customise) to override them; Cancel restores the prior profile
                    snapshot for that Customise session. Optional dropsets are per exercise. Pick lifts from the catalog, or add a private custom that
                    only you see. Use the one-line <strong class="text-foreground">Exercise note</strong> beside working kg for a pin number, stack
                    label, or gym cue. Per-exercise <strong class="text-foreground">Deload Alternate</strong> stays available on every exercise

                    From a routine card, start a normal session or a Deload. Play walks you through setup, warm-ups, working sets, and rest. The
                    header shows which set you are on. On <strong class="text-foreground">Setup</strong>, you see each upcoming lift (A and B for a
                    superset) with the full plate guide so you can load before tapping Setup done. Done opens the log sheet; Log set writes the weight
                    and reps; Cancel backs out without saving that set. If the exercise has a note, it is shown beside the target. Tap the
                    <strong class="text-foreground">Note</strong> field in the log sheet to keep the prefilled label or record what you actually used
                    for this working-set slot.

                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    Rest counts down with ticks near the end. Skip rest if you need to. You can add or remove incomplete working sets mid-session —
                    that edits this workout, not the routine. On a working set you can also
                    <strong class="text-foreground">Promote to dropset</strong> or <strong class="text-foreground">Demote to single</strong> before

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">What a bump is</h2>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    A <strong class="text-foreground">bump</strong> is a confirmed increase to that exercise’s
                    <strong class="text-foreground">working weight on the routine</strong> — the load the next standard session will prescribe. It is
                    progressive overload, one lift at a time. The app never silently adds plates; you tick the lifts you want on the finish screen.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    You earn a <strong class="text-foreground">finish bump</strong> when you hit the exercise’s prescribed
                    <strong class="text-foreground">Target</strong> reps at (or above) the snapshotted working weight. Which set counts depends on
                    your <strong class="text-foreground">Progression style</strong> on the routine (snapshotted when the workout starts):

                <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 text-muted-foreground">
                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-foreground">Straight Sets</strong> (default) — same weight for every working set in the block. A finish
                        bump is offered if <em>any</em> working set at that weight hit Target.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-foreground">Progressive Overload</strong> — when a working set hits Target, the <em>next</em> set can go
                        up by 2.5 kg (Ask on rest, or Auto-bump next set). Logged weight always wins over the suggested bump. A finish bump is offered
                        only if your <em>final</em> working set in the block was at the session’s top weight and hit Target — backing off on later
                        sets (e.g. 85 → 82.5 → 82.5) does not earn a finish bump even if an earlier set was heavy.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    Mid-block bumps only change what Play prefills for the next set; they do not update the routine until you finish. Say yes to a
                    finish bump and next time that lift starts heavier. Say no, and the routine stays put (carry-forward can still raise it if you
                    already lifted more than the prescribed weight).
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    <strong class="text-foreground">Carry-forward</strong> is the quiet cousin: finishing a standard session sets the routine to the
                    highest achieved top weight from that workout, without asking, and only ever up. A finish bump is the extra +2.5 kg step on top
                    when you hit Target under your progression style. Deload sessions do neither.

                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    A <strong class="text-foreground">Deload</strong> is the same routine, started lighter — not a second programme. From the routine
                    card you start <strong class="text-foreground">standard</strong> or Deload. Deload applies each exercise’s
                    <strong class="text-foreground">profile deload factors</strong> (weight and reps multipliers from its Exercise Profile) to the
                    snapshot, so Strength and Hypertrophy on the same routine can deload differently. Warm-ups are omitted; the working weights are
                    already light.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    Edit those factors on the profile in Preferences (new Custom profiles start at 0.5× weight / 0.5× reps). Saving a profile
                    auto-updates the factors on every assigned exercise. In the editor, above the exercise list, each routine can set
                    <strong class="text-foreground">Deload Velocity</strong> — how many finished standard sessions on that routine before Dashboard
                    softly hints at a Deload. Set velocity to 0 to never hint (handy for rare or one-off routines). Training keeps a velocity default
                    for new routines. The hint is not a calendar and it does not start the session for you.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    Optional <strong class="text-foreground">Deload Alternate</strong> on an exercise swaps in a different lift for Deload only, with
                    its own working weight and optional note used as-is (the weight factor does not scale that alternate). Prescribed reps still come
                    from the primary via that exercise’s reps factor. If an alternate is set, that lift’s Deload snapshot is singles — no dropsets.
                    Finishing a Deload does not bump or carry-forward your usual working weights.
